Understanding Immigration Law.

Immigration law governs who can enter, stay, and become a citizen of a country. Each nation has its own rules, but most focus on:

1. Visas & Entry Permits – Temporary permission to visit, work, or study.
2. Residency – Long-term permission to live in a country.
3. Citizenship – The process of becoming a full member of a nation.

Key terms include:
- Visa: A document allowing entry for a specific purpose.
- Green Card: A permit for permanent residency in the U.S.
- Naturalization: The process of becoming a citizen.

These laws shape a nation’s identity and impact the lives of millions seeking opportunity, safety, or a new beginning.
