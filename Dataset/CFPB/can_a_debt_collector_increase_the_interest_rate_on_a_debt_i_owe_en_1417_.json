    "last_reviewed": "SEP 14, 2022",
    "language": "English",
    "main_content": "The interest rate or fees charged on your debt may be increased if your original loan or credit agreement permits it and no law prohibits the increase, or if state law expressly permits the interest or fee. Some state laws and some contracts allow interest to be charged and costs to be added. If you still have the contract, it may say what interest rate can be charged or how much it can increase. State law may also limit the amount of interest charged.   The CFPB has prepared sample letters that a consumer could use to respond to a debt collector. These letters include tips on how to use them. The sample letters may help you to get information. You can use one of the sample letters to request information about why the interest rate was increased. Another sample letter is to stop or limit any further communication. Always keep a copy of your letter for your records.",
    "key_message": "A debt collector may not collect any interest or fee not authorized by the agreement or by law."
