Even a small charge or withdrawal can be a danger sign. Thieves sometimes will take a small amount from your checking account and then return to take much more if the small debit goes unnoticed.\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n                \n    \t\t    \n  \t\t  \n    \n  \t\t  \n    \t\t    Credit reports\n    \t\t    \n                \n                  \n\n\n    \n    \n        Review your free credit reports from each of the three major credit bureaus.
