    "main_content": "Tip\n\tLenders need to evaluate your ability to repay the loan, but they are not allowed to discriminate based on your national origin. See more about your rights and how to spot illegal discrimination.\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n    \n        Some people in the United States who cannot get a Social Security number – usually noncitizens, their spouses, and their dependents – are issued an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) so they can file taxes.Some lenders have mortgage programs tailored for ITIN holders who do not have proof of legal residency. To be approved for a mortgage with your ITIN, you need to meet the lender’s eligibility requirements. Each lender might have different requirements for borrowers with ITINs. Generally, loans for ITIN borrowers require higher down payments and carry higher interest rates, compared to traditional mortgage loans. You should compare loan options, fees, and interest rates from several lenders.Not all lenders that offer ITIN mortgages advertise them. Contact banks, credit unions, and other lenders and mortgage brokers in your area to ask about ITIN mortgages.",
