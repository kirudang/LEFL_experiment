    "main_content": "If youâ€™re not a customer, credit issuers, also known as creditors, must have your permission to pull your credit report. However, they can get your name and address from a credit report company to send you an unsolicited, even pre-qualified, offer. This exchange between the creditor and the credit reporting company is often referred to as a credit push. You can opt-out of receiving these offers .If you accept the offer and apply for a credit card, the card issuer will then access your credit report or score, and your credit report will show you applied for a credit card. This is known as a hard inquiry, and it can impact your credit score depending on how many cards or other loans you apply for.",
    "key_message": "No. Your credit score is not affected by card issuers obtaining your name in this way."
