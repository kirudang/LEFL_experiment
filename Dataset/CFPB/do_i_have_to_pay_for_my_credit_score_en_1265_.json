    "main_content": "You actually have more than one credit score. Credit scores are calculated based on the information in your credit reports. If the information about you in the credit reports of the three large consumer reporting companies is different, your credit score from each of the companies will be different. Lenders also use different scoring models for different types of loans, and different models might generate slightly different scores.Some credit score sources provide an \"educational\" credit score to consumers, instead of a score that a lender would use. The CFPB published a report on the differences between educational scores and those used by lenders . For most people, an educational score is similar to the scores lenders use and can be helpful. But the scores can be quite different for some. Our report found a meaningful difference for one out of four people. When choosing where to get your credit score, find out what kind of score is offered.",
    "key_message": "Credit reporting companies may charge you a fee for your credit scores, but you may be able to get a free score from your credit card issuer, another lender, or from a non-profit credit or housing counselor."
