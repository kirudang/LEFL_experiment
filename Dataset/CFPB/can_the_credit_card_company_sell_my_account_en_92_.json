    "main_content": "When your account is sold, the credit card company that buys your account becomes your new card company. Your new card company generally cannot increase the interest rate on any existing balance, except in certain circumstances. The new card company can increase the interest rate for new transactions, but it must give you 45 daysâ€™ notice. The new card company also can change other terms, but it must follow the same rules about giving notice that would apply if the account had not been sold and your old credit card company wanted to make the change.",
    "key_message": "Yes, most cardholder agreements allow the credit card company to sell your account to another card company. This can happen even when your card is active and in good standing. The new card company mails a new card to you, often with a new account number. You might not receive the new card for a number of months."
