    "main_content": "You should dispute a debt if you believe you don’t owe it or the information and amount is incorrect.While you can submit your dispute at any time, sending it in writing within 30 days of receiving a validation notice, which can be your initial communication with the debt collector, requires them to stop their collection activity until they’ve sent you a verification that responds to your dispute.After they’ve sent you verification of the debt, the collector can continue to contact you unless you take other actions, such as telling them in writing to stop or by taking other legal action. If you still disagree about whether a debt is yours or whether the information or amount is accurate, you may continue to dispute the debt with the debt collector.If you find the disputed debt on your credit report, you can also dispute it with the credit reporting companies. You can consider contacting a lawyer that specializes in debt collection cases if you don’t believe you can resolve the issue with the debt collector or credit reporting companies. If you win your lawsuit, you can recover lawyer fees and other court costs.",
    "key_message": "A debt collector must stop all collection activity on a debt if you send them a written dispute about the debt, generally within 30 days after your initial communication with them. Collection activities can restart, though, after the debt collector sends verification responding to the dispute."
