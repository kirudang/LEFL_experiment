    "main_content": "Some dealers allow customers to take their new vehicle home before the loan has been finalized or fully approved by the lender. This is called \"spot delivery\" or \"conditional financing.” Most auto loan contracts have a clause or a separate agreement that allows the dealer to renegotiate the deal if they later find that the deal you signed isn’t to the dealer’s liking. This is a good reason to consider other ways to finance a vehicle.If you drive away before finalizing the deal, you risk having the dealership calling you later to say they can’t make the loan at the agreed-upon terms and that they can only offer a loan with higher interest rate, a longer term, a larger down payment, or a combination of those terms. This practice is called “yo-yo” financing.",
    "key_message": "Make sure the financing is final before you take the car home. A clause in many contracts allows the dealer to renegotiate the deal after you drive the car off the lot."
