    "main_content": "It’s a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) for a debt collector to have you arrested or claim that you’ll be arrested if you don’t pay a debt – this is harassment. However, they may file a lawsuit against you to collect the debt, and if the court orders you to appear or to provide certain information but you don’t comply, a judge may issue a warrant for your arrest.In some cases, a judge may also issue a warrant if you don’t comply with a court-ordered installment plan. You should never ignore a court order.",
    "key_message": "A debt collector can’t threaten to or have you arrested for an unpaid debt. If you’re sued and you don’t comply with a court order, though, you could be arrested."
