    "main_content": "You should never ignore a court order. If you get a court order to appear, you should go to court and provide any required information. You may want to consult with an attorney to help you with your court appearance. If a lender threatens to have you arrested, you should report the lenderâ€™s threat to your state attorney general  and to your state regulator. You can also submit a complaint with the CFPB online or by calling 1-855-411-CFPB (2372).",
    "key_message": "No, you cannot be arrested for defaulting on a payday loan. However, if you are sued or a court judgment has been entered against you and you ignore a court order to appear, a judge may issue a warrant for your arrest."
