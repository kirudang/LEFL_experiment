    "main_content": "Condominiums, co-ops, and some neighborhoods may require you to join the local homeowners’ association and pay dues (HOA dues).Tip: Homeowners’ association dues can range from a few hundred dollars a month to more than one thousand dollars a month. Be sure to factor in this cost when deciding if you can afford the mortgage to purchase a home or refinance.  Although not common, your mortgage servicer may be willing to include your HOA dues in the escrow portion of your monthly mortgage payment upon request.",
    "key_message": "Usually not. Condo/co-op fees or homeowners’ association dues are usually paid directly to the homeowners’ association (HOA) and are not included in the payment you make to your mortgage servicer."
