    "main_content": "If you’re having trouble getting cash from a credit card, it’s possible that the transaction put you above your credit card’s limit for cash withdraws, which is known as a cash advance. Many credit cards have an overall credit limit and a separate lower limit for cash advances and checks written from your credit card account.",
    "key_message": "Yes, you can withdraw cash using a credit card, though it is expensive to do so. However, there may be situations where you’re unable to withdraw cash from an ATM using your credit card because you’ve reached the credit limit for a cash advance on your card. Check your credit card’s terms or contact the company to find out what happened."
