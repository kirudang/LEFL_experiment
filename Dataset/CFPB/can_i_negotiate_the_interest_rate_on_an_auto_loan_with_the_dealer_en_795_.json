    "main_content": "There are a number of ways you can get or finance an auto loan, including going directly to a bank, credit union, or finance company, or going through your dealer.If you choose to arrange your financing through your dealer, they will collect your information and send that information to one or more lenders, who will propose an interest rate to the dealer. This is known as the “buy rate.” The dealer will choose the offer to present to you, but they may have an incentive to charge you more than the proposed buy rate. When the dealer provides you with a loan at a rate above the “buy rate”, he sells the loan to the creditor for more than the face amount you borrowed. That is, the dealer can sell your loan at a premium. This means that the interest rate you receive through a dealership is generally higher, but you can negotiate this rate, along with other loan terms.",
    "key_message": "Yes, just like the price of the vehicle, the interest rate is negotiable. Dealers might not offer you the lowest rate that you qualify for. To get the best interest rate, shop around with multiple lenders and negotiate."
