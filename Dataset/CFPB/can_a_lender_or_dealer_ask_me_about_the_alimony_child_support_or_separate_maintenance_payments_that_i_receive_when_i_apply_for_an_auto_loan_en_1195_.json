    "main_content": "A lender or dealer may ask whether income stated in your application comes from alimony, child support, or separate maintenance payments. However, the lender or dealer must first tell you that you do not have to reveal such income if you do not want it considered.If you do want to have the dealer or lender consider your alimony, child support, or maintenance payments, the lender or dealer may consider the amount of such income and likelihood that it will continue. In determining this, a lender or dealer may consider factors such as whether there is a written agreement or court decree, how long and how regularly you have been receiving payments, the availability of court or other procedures to compel payment, and the creditworthiness of the payor when that information is available.",
    "key_message": "Yes, but only if you want the lender or dealer to consider such payments as part of your application for credit."
